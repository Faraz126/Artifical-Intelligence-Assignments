# Artifical-Intelligence-Assignments
This repository contains assignments for the course Artificial Intelligence course, taken in Fall 2019 at Habib University.

## Assignment 1
This focused on search techniques, namely generation of search space and then applying A* algorithm. Formulating a problem as a search problem was also a part of the assignment.

## Assignment 2
This assignment focused primarily on Machine learning. One part of the assignment required us to build a naive bayes classifier for text classification, while another requirted us to use scikit learn for the fashion-MNIST dataset. We also had to implement kmean's clustering.

## Assignment 3
This assignment required us to implement collaborative filtering with gradient descent method.

## Assignment 4
This assignment focused on knowledge representation. We had to build models in prolog, and another baysian network. We also had to draw inference from the baysian network.
